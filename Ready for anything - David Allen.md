# Ready for anything - David Allen

Unlike those tasks that don't demand much from your brain – like filling out forms, writing a shopping list or responding to a routine email – creative work requires lots of “mental horsepower.”

Why?

Creative work is a mental balancing act. At any one time, a creative act requires that you keep in mind – and evaluate – many different considerations simultaneously.

For example, when a screenwriter is in the process of writing a script, she has to reckon with many different things. She must come up with a convincing story and a compelling narrative. She will need to invent effective visual metaphors for the characters' emotional states – like, using heavy rainfall to symbolize sadness. She'll have to ensure that the script doesn't require too many different shooting locations, as that will increase production costs. And she'll also have to do a lot of background research, especially if her story is set in an ancient era, or something similar.


Balancing all of these factors simultaneously requires a lot of mental effort. Moreover, that effort depends on us having a kind of mental “storage space.” However, for most of us, this space is at a premium.

All of the information that will be relevant in the short- to mid-term is stored in what we'll call a kind of psychic RAM. The information that we store there ranges from the subtotal of a bill that you're calculating to the fact that you need to buy milk. Crucially, creative thought also depends on this psychic RAM.

Unfortunately, the capacity of our psychic RAM is limited. Attempting to keep in mind a lot of information at once will result in your RAM becoming too full to process any new ideas. Which means, of course, that your creativity will suffer.

If we cannot be creative while our heads are filled with mundane details, memos, facts and so on, then it follows that we must find a way to clear our minds of such information.

## Don't keep all your promising ideas in your head.


As we've seen, storing too much information in your psychic RAM will hinder your creativity. But there are also other reasons to stop trying to store all your ideas in your head.

First, if you don't set down an idea when it comes to you, it may very well be unavailable when you need it.

This is because our psychic RAM is rather limited, so older information might be deleted to make space for new information. Indeed, the best idea you've ever had could be nudged out of your RAM by a newer, far more mundane one – like, “must buy milk.”

Also, information stored in your RAM is badly organized, so you might find yourself unable to retrieve that great idea when you need it.

For instance, imagine you're preparing for your finals, and a fantastic business idea pops into your head. Once the exams are over, when you finally have time to consider the idea, you might not have access to it because it's become buried under all the information you needed for the exams.
But by writing down your ideas, you no longer depend on your psychic RAM, and those ideas will be far easier to retrieve when you need them.

Yet, there's more to writing ideas down than keeping them safe: writing also helps us to define and evaluate them. There's a vast difference between an idea and its real- world application. When you first have an idea – say, for a business – it's usually not very clear, but rather a jumble of vague thoughts and possible conclusions, like “save costs” or “interns.”

The process of writing the idea down in complete sentences forces us to structure it more clearly and helps us to see any faulty conclusions we may have made. For example, the written statement “By hiring interns, we can save 20 percent on our costs” is far easier to evaluate than the embryonic idea that exists only in the mind.

## Being aware of your job, goals and current tasks will enable you to make good decisions about the work to come

David Allen, mentions a scenario, where you imagine that you get the opportunity you've been waiting for: the chance to shoot a documentary. Then reality kicks in – unfortunately,your plate is rather full with teaching Media Science at a university.

How do you decide whether you can fit making that film into your schedule?

Simply being aware of the tasks you've committed to will help you in your decision. Writing down any current duties and projects – like future classes and seminars you've agreed to teach – helps you to see clearly how much time and energy you're already investing, and thus whether there's enough left over to give to that film project.

Furthermore, if you're aware of your commitments, you're in a position to consider the possibility of dropping certain tasks, or delegating them to someone else so that you can make space in your life for an attractive new project. Perhaps you could even allocate some of your classes to a keen research student so you can make the documentary.

But even if you've listed all of your commitments, and are now fully aware of them, you'll still have to decide which activities are more important than others. To prioritize in this way, you need to attain clarity about your job description and goals. Then you can determine the importance of the tasks in relation to a particular reference point.

In our case, a good reference point is your job: How important is a particular task in relation to your job description? If your job is Media Science lecturer, and the semester has just begun, clearly teaching will be closer to your job description than making a documentary.

Another reference point could be your aspirations: Is it your ultimate goal to become a filmmaker? If so, then perhaps you should seriously consider quitting teaching and taking the opportunity that's in front of you.

## The best plans prepare for difficulties and interruptions ahead of time.

No matter your area of work, every project you plan will involve its own set of risks and difficulties, such as bad weather, or an investor who pulls out, and so on. However, it is often possible to prepare for things that might go awry.

In fact, the best time to deal with potential obstacles is while a project is still in the planning stages, and not when it's already underway. During this time, there are many opportunities to prepare for things that may go wrong.

For example, imagine that you're planning a large garden party and you anticipate rain on the big day. In such a case, you'll have plenty of time to arrange a party tent, or come up with fun indoor activities, just to be safe. Thus, no matter the weather, your party is set to go smoothly.

On the other hand, if you hadn't used the planning stages to deal with potential problems, and a thunderstorm catches you by surprise, you'll have far fewer options – for instance, you wouldn’t have a tent on standby.
Furthermore, on any project, delays and interruptions are to be expected. So, if your timetable doesn't allow for such interruptions, every unforeseen event will result in your project running behind schedule.

Just imagine a stage designer who knows his team can build a dummy ship in eight hours under normal conditions. If he schedules this task for the very day of the premiere performance, there will be no time reserve to fall back on should a co- worker call in sick or the paint not dry in time.

Aside from the fact that working this way puts his team under a lot of unnecessary pressure, the designer risks not completing his work in time for the premiere, which creates problems for the theater and everyone involved.

**Advice?** A good timetable/planning will accommodate such delays and prevent major problems from arising.

## Organizing

By organizing your work into a system that places all your to-do tasks in one location where you can keep track of them, you won't feel overwhelmed. Instead, you'll feel in control and able to devote time to each task without wanting to escape by doing other, less important tasks.

Also, the more organized you are, the more time and available psychic RAM you'll have to be creative.

Creative work, like any other work, takes a lot of time. So if your time is wasted because of chaotic working habits, you'll find less opportunities for creativity. Such bad habits also result in your psychic RAM filling up with non-essential information, leaving no mental space for creativity.

To avoid these obstacles, you should immediately complete those tasks that you're sure won't take longer than two minutes. Doing this frees your mind and enables you to spend time on more important things.

For example, say you intend to steal the Mona Lisa – a particularly creative task! If you're going to plan such a heist so that it goes smoothly, you'll first have to make sure you've answered any urgent emails, and fed your dog, as you're going to need to free up some psychic RAM for all that planning!

## To reach your long-term goals, translate them into short-term action steps.

Imagine an English teacher who has created many interesting characters and has a great idea for an intriguing story. However, the act of transforming these ideas into a novel seems like far too ambitious a project, given that there's just too little time: too many lessons to plan, students to teach and assignments to correct.

Sound familiar?

In our everyday schedules, there's simply no time slot large enough to accommodate a big project. Writing that novel, for instance, will take a massive amount of time, and during our teacher’s typical workday there are many important tasks that must be dealt with immediately, such as answering parents' phone calls, supervising students and, of course, teaching classes.

However many small moments of free time exist throughout the day – between those tasks, and after the working day is done – there certainly won't be enough time to author the next Great American Novel.
So how can someone like our teacher achieve her goal?
The answer is that single “action steps” towards that long-term goal can be easily slotted into one's schedule.

To get started, our English teacher could break down her novel project into action steps, such as finding a title, creating a rough structure, or even writing just one page per day. Compared with attempting to tackle the whole project at once, each of these steps will take only a very brief amount of time.

Once she organizes her project and her time into manageable steps, our teacher will find that, suddenly, the work of writing her novel fits snugly into the slivers of free time she has between teaching, grading and lesson planning. And, eventually, completing each of those manageable tasks will result in our teacher finishing the first draft of her magnum opus!


## Summary

If you want to be more creative and productive in your personal or professional life, then you have to prepare yourself. This involves using techniques to free up your “psychic RAM” as well as developing the mental flexibility to effectively shift your focus to wherever it’s needed at any given time.
