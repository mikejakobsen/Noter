# The Myth of Multitasking - Dave Crenshaw

How many different apps do you have open on your phone right now? How many tabs on your internet browser? And how many different e-mail threads and Facebook messages?

If you’re like most people, you probably have a lot of each of these – too many, in fact. The myth of multitasking has seeped into every aspect of our lives, not only in terms of how we communicate but also the way we work and live the rest of our day-to- day lives.

And multitasking might be a bigger problem than you think; not only is splitting our time into fragments not helpful or efficient, it is actually counterproductive.

## There's no such thing as multitasking

Multitasking is a lie. A more accurate name for this method of working is switchtasking, and it is an inefficient way of getting things done.

The humas brain is an impressive thing to behold, but it dosen't perform well when you attmept to focus on more than one thing at a time.

**Active switches** happen in situations you create yourself, such as deciding to check your e-mail while talking to someone on the phone. These would be switches that you are actively making.

**Passive switches** happen in situations that are initiated by something or someone else.

An example of this would be when you’re facing a deadline and, in the middle of preparing documents, a coworker decides to stop by and start talking to you. Here, you’re being asked to switch your attention between the documents and your coworker.
  

Switching between tasks is ultimately inefficient and a waste of time, because whether you are making active or passive switches, you will inevitably need to stop one train of thought to start another.


## Key Message

It is time to close the book on multitasking. This flawed notion of being able to do everything at once has been a drain on workplaces for far too long. The fact of the matter is that dividing our attention among more than one task at a time is simply impossible; what we are really doing is switching back and forth between activities and tasks and, as a result, are spending more time getting less done.
