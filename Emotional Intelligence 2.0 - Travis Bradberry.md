# Emotional Intelligence 2.0 - Travis Bradberry


Some people are uncommonly good at reading body language, able to judge at a glance what someone is thinking – and respond accordingly. They can calm a coworker who’s angry, or reassure a friend who’s anxious.

Why are certain people so good at this? The answer has to do with emotional intelligence, or EQ.

Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and understand your own feelings and the feelings of others, and influence those feelings to your advantage. A person who's good at “reading” people has high emotional intelligence.

EQ is based upon four different elements.

**The first** is self-awareness, or the ability to understand your own feelings and behaviors.

**The second** is self-management. Self-management is about keeping yourself in situations in which you know you'll be able to behave correctly.

**The third** is social awareness. Once you know how to manage your behavior and understand your feelings, you'll know how to read the emotions of others. You'll understand what makes people feel angry, sad or excited, and you'll be able to better read body language.

**The fourth** and final element is relationship management. Understanding your own behavior and the behavior of others around you enables you to build stronger relationships with the important people in your life.

For example, if you know that one of your colleges gets upset when he's criticized, you'll know how to give feedback to which he'll be able to respond more effectively.

## How well do you know yourself ?

You might know what sort of things you like or dislike, but self-awareness is more than that. It's about deeply understanding your emotions, so you don't become overwhelmed by them.

It's important to understand why you feel the way you do, including when you’re angry or annoyed. Being in a bad mood doesn't necessarily mean you have to have a bad day.

Maybe you left your briefcase at home, spilled coffee all over your desk or had trouble getting your coworkers to stay on task. On days like this, you might start to feel negative about everything and even lash out at small things – which only makes things worse.

When you find yourself in a bad mood, just remember that such feelings do pass. Whatever has put you in a bad mood can't possibly be the end of the world, so why overreact?
Don't lose sight of your self-awareness on good days, either. We tend to rush into things head first when we're in a good mood.

Imagine your favorite store is having a sale with markdowns of 75 percent, for example. You might want to run in and buy everything you see!

In that moment, your excitement overpowers your other emotions. You might forget to pause and ask yourself if you really need the things you're buying – and your good mood would probably turn sour quickly when those credit card bills come due!

So check yourself and think twice when you get excited – don't make rash decisions just because you're caught up in the moment.

Remember to always consider what the consequences of your actions might be, or if it's based on temporary feelings.

## Summary

You can increase your level of emotional intelligence, or EQ. Focus on understanding and controlling your own emotions and behaviors first, then build your relationships by paying attention to body language and addressing people in a personal way. 
Balance your emotions with rational thinking, and never stop trying to improve yourself through feedback. When you have high emotional intelligence, you don't just relate better to others – you'll manage yourself better, too.
