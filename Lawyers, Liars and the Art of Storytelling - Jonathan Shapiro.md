# Lawyers, Liars and the Art of Storytelling - Jonathan Shapiro

The roots of modern storytelling reach all the way back to ancient Greece and the works of the philosopher, Aristotle.

Aristotle was the first to identify the three key elements of convincing storytelling: ethos, logos and pathos, which in English, translate to credibility, logic and emotion.

## Key messages

The best way to persuade audiences is not with legalistic mumbo-jumbo. It’s far better to tell a story that adheres to the principles laid out in the Aristotelian rhetorical triangle. By combining, ethos, logos and pathos – credibility, logic and emotion – lawyers can create compelling narratives that are sure to convince both jurors and prospective clients.

Actionable advice:
Don’t forget that the most convincing stories have both a hero and a villain.Although this is obvious in some criminal cases – murder trials, for instance – it’s possible for even the dullest bureaucratic case to have a good guy and a bad guy, too.
