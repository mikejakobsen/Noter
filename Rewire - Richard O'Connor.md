We've all been through this: you're faced with two choices, you know which one is right, yet you choose the wrong one. Why do we do that?
It's because we all really have two selves – a conscious self and an automatic self. They both influence our decisions.

The automatic self acts without our direct control. It's what's influencing you when you mindlessly eat a bag of chips while watching TV.
The conscious self uses rational thought and reason. When you decide to try octopus for the first time, your conscious self is in charge.

Usually, when you do something you regret, it's because your automatic self is in control, and your conscious self isn't considering the consequences. You eat those chips without thinking about it.
So if you want to overcome any bad behavior, you have to train your automatic self to stop slipping. Strengthening your conscious self to be more dominant is also useful, but training your automatic self is more effective.
Brains can physically change. You can direct the ways your brain develops, and how it affects your behavior.

Our brains are constantly building new cells, and new networks between them. In fact, it's recently been discovered that learning actually causes the growth of new cells; our behavior affects brain cell growth, thereby brain function.
When you do any action repeatedly, your nerve cells grow more and more connections with each other. For example, “go to the gym” (nerve A) will connect with “stay at the gym until my workout is done” (nerve B).
As you work out more and more, it'll become a habit. Nerves A and B will increasingly bond together.

So when we develop good habits, we replace bad habits. You need to change your automatic habits from negative to positive ones.

## Bad habits

Unfortunately, it's not easy to unlearn the bad habits in our automatic system.
Our automatic self has many habits – some that benefit us, and some that hurt us. Habits form when repeated patterns of behavior become normal, and form new pathways in the brain.
We learn our good and bad habits subconsciously. A bad habit might be watching TV and eating chips after work, instead of going to the gym. A good habit could be brushing your teeth.

Some habits, like smoking, are clearly harmful. Other times, however, habits that we think are good are actually destructive. Self-serving biases lead to deceptively destructive habits.

Self-serving biases affect the way we see ourselves and the world. We claim that we're responsible for our good characteristics, but blame our faults on the outside world.
For example, imagine a man who tactlessly checks out every woman he meets. He might justify his behavior by saying, “I'm just a man with human desires.” That reasoning makes it seem like it's not his fault. But if he performs well at work, he'll think that's because of his own dedication and perseverance, not because he is fortunate enough to be in a supportive work environment in a growing industry.
Interestingly, most happy and confident people benefit from the self-serving bias of believing they earned their happiness and confidence. This can be detrimental, though, if it distorts reality.

If someone becomes overconfident in her abilities, she may stop trying hard. We tend to ignore anything that goes against our self-serving biases. Our beliefs keep reinforcing themselves.

If you hear that a person is unintelligent before you meet him, you're more likely to interpret him that way when you actually meet. The opposite may be true if the person is introduced as a professor.

These sorts of biases operate unconsciously, so they don't usually get corrected by the conscious self. Instead, we fall into making the same mistakes without having chosen to do so.
