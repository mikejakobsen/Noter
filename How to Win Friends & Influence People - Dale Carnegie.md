# How to Win Friends & Influence People - Dale Carnegie

[1936]

It is our actions, not our words, that show others what we think of them. Thus, when we meet someone new, the easiest way to say “I like you and am very happy to meet you” is to smile.

We humans are suckers for people who smile at us. If we meet someone new and see them smile, we tend to automatically like them as well. The smile of a baby, for example, immediately makes us feel warm and fuzzy inside, as does seeing a dog wag his tail like crazy because he’s so happy to see us.

If you want to make yourself instantly likeable, the first thing to do is to show others how much you enjoy being around them. If you’re happy to see someone, the other person will be happy to see you too.

Psychologists have also uncovered a positive side-effect of excessive smiling. It seems that the connection between positive emotions and smiling is not a one-way street; consciously smiling can lead to positive emotions, just as positive emotions can lead to (involuntary) smiling.

This means that by smiling, we not only make other people happier, but ourselves as well.

Hence it can be said that while a smile costs nothing, it brings a lot of joy for everyone involved.
