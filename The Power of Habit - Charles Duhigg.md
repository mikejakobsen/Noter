# The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg

Habits are simple cue- routine-reward loops that save effort and endure.

Our brains are constantly looking for ways to save energy. Research shows that one way they do this is by turning activities into habits.

Hence, even a complicated act that demands concentration at first, like backing out of the driveway, eventually becomes an effortless habit. Research has indicated that as many as 40 percent of the actions you perform each day are based on habit and not on conscious decisions.
In general, any habit can be broken down into a three-part loop:
First, you sense an external cue, say, your alarm clock ringing. This creates an overall decides which habit is appropriate for the situation.

Next comes the routine, meaning the activity you’re used to performing when faced with this particular cue. You march into the bathroom and brush your teeth with your brain virtually on autopilot.

Finally, you get a reward: a feeling of success and, in this case, a minty-fresh tingling sensation in your mouth. Your overall brain activity increases again as your brain registers the successful completion of the activity and reinforces the link between the cue and routine.
Habits are incredibly resilient: in some cases, people with extensive brain damage who could not even remember where they lived could still adhere to their old habits and pick up new ones. This is because learning and maintaining habits happens in the basal ganglia, a part of your brain that can function normally even if the rest of your brain is damaged.

Unfortunately, this resilience means that even if you kick a bad habit, like smoking, you will always be at risk of relapsing.

## Habits stick

Imagine this scenario: every afternoon for the past year, you’ve bought and eaten a delicious, sugar-laden chocolate-chip cookie from the cafeteria at your workplace. Call it a just reward for a hard day’s work.
Unfortunately, as a few friends have already pointed out, you’ve started putting on weight, so you decide to kick the habit. But how do you imagine you’ll feel that first afternoon, walking past the cafeteria? Odds are, you will either eat “just one more cookie” or you’ll go home in a distinctly grumpy mood.

Kicking a bad habit is hard because you develop a craving for the reward at the end of the habit loop. Studies on animals have shown that once they become used to a simple cue-routine-reward habit, their brains begin anticipating the reward even before they get it. And once they anticipate it, denying them the actual reward makes them frustrated and mopey. This is the neurological basis of craving.

Craving works for good habits as well. Research indicates that people who manage to exercise habitually crave something from the exercise, be it the endorphin rush in their brain, the sense of accomplishment or the treat they allow themselves afterward. This craving is what solidifies the habit; cues and rewards alone are not enough.

Companies and advertisers work hard to understand and create such cravings in consumers. Consider Claude Hopkins, the man who popularized Pepsodent toothpaste when countless other toothpastes had failed. He provided a reward that created craving: namely, the cool, tingling sensation that today is a staple of all toothpastes. That sensation not only “proved” that the product worked in consumers’ minds; it also became a reward that they began to crave.

## Substitute the routine

Ask any smoker looking to quit: when the craving for nicotine hits, it’s hard to ignore. Hence, the trick is to still respond to the craving, but with something other than smoking.

**This is the golden rule of changing any habit: don’t resist craving, redirect it.** 
Keep the same cues and rewards, but change the routine that occurs as a result of that craving.

AA asks participants to list what exactly they crave from drinking. Usually, factors
like relaxation and companionship are far more important than the actual intoxication. AA then provides new routines that address those cravings, such as going to meetings and talking to sponsors for companionship, effectively substituting drinking with something less harmful.

Though this works well in general, stressful circumstances can cause relapses. For example, one recovering alcoholic had been sober for years when his mother called to say she had cancer. After hanging up, he left work and went directly to a bar, and then, in his own words, was “pretty much drunk for the next two years.”

## Keystone habits

Some habits, known as keystone habits, are more important than others, because adhering to them creates positive effects that spill over into other areas. For instance, research indicates that doctors have a hard time getting obese people to make a broad change in their lifestyle, but when patients focus on developing one keystone habit, such as keeping a meticulous food journal, other positive habits start to take root as well.

The reason a keystone habit works is that it provides small wins, meaning early successes that are fairly easy to attain.

Achieving the keystone habit helps you believe that change in other spheres of life is possible, too, starting a cascade of positive changes.

## Willpower

Willpower is in fact a skill that can be learned.

But why then is our willpower so inconsistent? Some days hitting the gym is no problem, whereas, on others, leaving the sofa is nigh impossible.


It turns out, willpower is actually like a muscle: it can tire. If you exhaust it concentrating on, say, a tedious spreadsheet at work, you might have no willpower left when you get home. But the analogy goes even further: by engaging in habits that demand resolution – say, adhering to a strict diet – you can actually strengthen your willpower. A willpower workout, if you will.

## Habits can be changed

One night in 2008, Brian Thomas strangled his wife to death. Distraught, he promptly turned himself in and was prosecuted for murder. His defense? He was experiencing a sleep terror, like physically acting out a nightmare: Thomas thought he was strangling a burglar who was attacking his wife.
In court, the defense argued that when Thomas thought someone was hurting his wife, it triggered an automatic response, in this case to protect her. In other words, he followed a habit.

At the same time, Angie Bachman was sued by the casino company Harrah’s for half a million dollars in outstanding gambling debts. This was after she had already gambled away her home and million-dollar inheritance.

In court, Bachman argued that she too was merely following a habit: gambling felt good, so when Harrah’s sent her tempting offers for free trips to the casino, she could not resist. Note that Harrah’s knew she was a compulsive gambler who had already declared bankruptcy.

In the end, Thomas was acquitted and many, including the trial judge, expressed great sympathy for him. Bachman, on the other hand, lost the case, and was the object of considerable public scorn.

Both Thomas and Bachman could quite plausibly claim: “It wasn’t me, it was my habits!” So why was only one acquitted?
Quite simply, once we become aware of a harmful habit, it becomes our responsibility to address and change it. Thomas didn’t know he would hurt anyone in his sleep. Bachman, however, knew she had a gambling habit, and could have avoided Harrah’s offers by participating in an exclusion program that would’ve prohibited gambling companies from marketing to her.

## Summary

Following habits is not only a key part of our lives but also a key part of organizations and companies. All habits comprise a cue-routine-reward loop, and the easiest way to change this is to substitute the routine with something else while keeping the cue and reward the same. Achieving lasting change in life is difficult, but it can be done by focusing on important keystone habits such as willpower.
