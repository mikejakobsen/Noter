# How the World Sees You - Sally Hogshead

First, you have to overcome the distractions that can keep people from connecting with your ideas.
It’s difficult to get someone to pay attention to your ideas if they don’t listen or bother to look at the portfolio you sent them. So, to get your message out there, you have to grab their attention right off the bat.

Sadly, the average attention span has shrunk to a mere nine seconds! So, if you want to have an impact on your audience, you have to act quickly and start strong.

You’re best off avoiding the desire to outperform everyone by trying to be the world’s best. Instead, you should aim for success by being different and creating a niche that plays to your own unique set of skills. Rather than trying to top Ernest Hemingway, embrace your own quirky writing style or subject matter and attract readers by setting yourself apart from the rest.

## Fascination

Fascination allows you to enter a state of flow, a psychological state in which you can focus on something completely. The stronger your fascination, the more likely you are to enter into this state.

**Flow** was discovered by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who defined it as being completely, blissfully and effortlessly immersed in an activity.

More importantly, being in a state of flow allows your brain to perform more efficiently, which improves your performance.

You may have heard of actors and musicians saying they are at the top of their game when they perform alongside the best in their field. Sally states that this is because fascination and flow are contagious to those around us.
