# Write It Down, Make It Happen - Henriette Anne Klauser

A lot of people only have vague ideas about what they really want. They desire more money, a better job, someone to love or the chance to travel somewhere exotic.

You may have similar desires of your own. But if you want to make them a reality, you need to be precise.

So rather than saying “I want money,” say, “I want exactly enough money to open a restaurant.” And when it comes to love, figure out exactly what you’re looking for. Maybe it’s someone who is funny, kind and doesn’t mind that you don’t want to have kids.

Being so specific might sound extreme, but if you want to reach your goals and not veer off course, you need to know exactly what it is you want.

Once you’re clear on your goals, write them down on paper.

Jim Carrey has a famous story of writing himself a check for $10 million, when he was just an aspiring actor. Sure enough, years later, he was earning $10 million per film!

## Why?

See if this sounds familiar: your friend calls to say he bought a new car – let’s say it’s a silver Seat – which surprises you since you’ve never heard of this car before.
The next day, however, you start to see this car everywhere you go, and many of them are silver, too! How is this possible?

This is the magic of your brain's filtering system, known as the Reticular Activating System, or RAS.

The RAS is what allows us to sharpen our attention, and it can be primed to notice, or not notice, certain things.

Parents of newborns are familiar with the RAS, as it is what allows them to sleep through just about anything, like traffic noise or a blaring television, yet wake up at the slightest peep from their baby. This is due to their RAS being biologically primed to hear when a child is in need.

This is the same mechanism that will allow you to hear when your name is mentioned across the room at a loud party.

According to Henriette, after you write down your goals, your RAS filter will constantly be on the lookout for messages or information that will help your

So, after writing down that you want enough money to open a restaurant, you’ll be primed to overhear someone at a party who says they have a history of investing in restaurants. Otherwise you never would have noticed.

## Fear

We all have unconscious fears, which are often tied to our goals, like big obstacles. However, by doing the same thing and writing these fears down on paper, you can help yourself recognize and conquer what stands in your way.

Henriette mentions that when fear goes unacknowledged, it sits in the gut, where it festers and acts like a spell that keeps you from being creative or having confidence in your power to follow through with your ideas.

## Rapidwriting

One of the best ways to get rid of worries is to express them through a technique called rapidwriting.

As the name suggests, rapidwriting involves quick, nonstop writing as way to power through a problem and work through worries, anger or issues that might be causing a mental block. In this technique, you never stop to look back at what you’ve written and just keep going.

Your first sentence might be something like, “I don't know what to write and think this is stupid . . .” But a few sentences later you’ll likely be pouring your heart onto the
page.

Rapidwriting apparently is a lot like the Jewish tradition of kvetching, which is a way of talking through your feelings and getting rid of anger or resentment. It might start as a bitter diatribe, but by the end you’ll have rid yourself of your negativity, will likely feel much better and will often have found a solution to your problems.


## Goals

Think of reaching a goal as flying a plane to a destination. Statistics show that 90 percent of the time, an airplane will have to fly slightly off course in order to avoid bad weather or to get out of the way of another plane’s flight path.

But these detours don’t change the fact that pilots are continuously focused on getting to their destination. The goal remains the same, but in order to reach it safely, they have to be flexible.

This is the same philosophy you need to apply to achieve your goals, so that when life inevitably throws something unexpected your way, you can remain focused and stay on track.

For instance, let’s say your goal is to find a new apartment. First of all, set your budget and write down precisely what you’re looking for, such as two bedrooms, a garden and a location that’s walking distance to a shopping district. In this case, being as precise as possible will allow you to quickly filter out all the apartments that don’t have two bedrooms, a garden and nearby shops.

Now, let’s say you find an apartment that meets all your requirements – but there’s something you didn’t expect: it's near a railroad track.

While the proximity to the train track is what gives the apartment such an attractive price, and the train only goes by twice a day, you might start ignoring all the good things and focus on this one negative. And even though you don’t mind the train tracks, youmight start imagining how other people will react.

This is exactly how you can get off track, lose sight of your goal and end up worrying about someone else’s dream.

So don’t get lost in hypothetical fears about what other people might think. You’ll miss your opportunity to enjoy something that would have been perfect for you.

## Starting off small


It’s nearly impossible to eat just one french fry. Even when they aren’t that great, after you eat one you’ll be tempted to eat another – and this is exactly how conquering your goals works as well.

One of the best motivators to help you achieve your goals is to successfully reach one of them, and then use the resulting psychological boost to your advantage.

The most obvious strategy is to start out with small goals and work your way up to the biggest one. So, if you want to swim across the English Channel, start with a series of smaller lakes that gradually get bigger, building your strength and confidence in the process.


The author also states that another way to boost the likelihood of reaching a goal is to align your desires with a greater good, such that they’re not purely about personal gain.

## Summary

No dream is too big for you to achieve, as long as you have the right attitude. Too often, our fears get in the way of what we hope to accomplish. But this can be remedied by writing down all that we desire and fear, thereby unlocking the power of the subconscious mind and putting us on the right path. The simple act of writing is a powerful one that is not unlike a prayer, and it can turn us into a magnet for the things we want most in our lives.

## Advice

Start your day off by writing down your intent.
Take some quiet time at the beginning of your day to write down what you’d like to accomplish in the hours ahead. 
This is not for practical stuff like doing the laundry or going shopping. It’s to provide emotional and spiritual guidance for the day, such as “being the best mother I can be.” Just writing your intent down will keep you feeling grateful and positive throughout the day.
