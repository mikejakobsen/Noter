You should learn to do ONE thing at a time, and ONLY one thing. No texting. No Facebooking. No twittering. Just the current task.

There's really no such thing as multitasking. Out brain is simply incapable of focusing on multiple things simultaneously.

## Eliminate distractions

We've all had the experience of meeting someone for the first time and the immediately forgetting their anme. It might not seem like it at the time, but it might be caused by multitasking.

Multitasking doesn’t necessarily mean a conscious effort to engage in numerous activities at the same time. It could be as simple as thinking about things other than the immediate task at hand.

Thoughts will creep into your mind; that’s natural. The trick is to prioritize what is most important in any particular situation and fully commit to that activity, guiding yourself back into focus when your mind wanders.

Just as important as maintaining focus is fending off potential distractions.

There are so many things in our lives that just beg for our attention. Be it a Facebook message, gripping news headlines, emails or a yapping co-worker, distractions are very much part of our everyday lives.

## Summary

Contrary to popular belief, the key to being more productive is not filling your schedule and tackling everything at once. Rather, you should singletask, or prioritize your tasks and work through them one at a time with focus and tranquility.
