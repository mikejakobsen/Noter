# Flow - Mihály Csikszentmihalyi


Flow er den mentale tilstand, hvor man er fuldt opslugt. Hvor din opmærksomhed er samlet. Hvor tid og rum ikke har betydning. Hvor der kun eksistere dette NU.

So in order to give our lives meaning, we try to change the encironment around us, whether by displaying our wealth to impress others or chasing powerful positions. Yes these all fail to sustain our happiness.

So, to get into a state of flow you should seek out new challenges in work, aiming to learn as much as possible about all of the essential tasks involved in keeping your company running, rather than just clocking in and clocking out.

## Key points

To live an optimal life, try not to be influenced by external rewards or the opinions of others. You can attain enjoument in life by focusing your attention on every moment, being mindful of your environment and immersing yourself in your interests. Finally, growth and achievement.

## Advice

Learn more about your job.

Set yourself a challenge to learn as much as possible about your job, accept opportunities for new tasks and work better and faster than you have before. Not only will this lead to less procrastination but the time will pass much more quickly. You’ll also become more popular with colleagues and you may even be offered a promotion, but don’t let these be your central motivations.

Turn off the TV and get creative.
Instead of watching TV or movies in the evening, engage with your friends, flatmates or community and challenge yourself to, for example, create and act in your own plays or start a book club. When you feel like drinking away your weekend, why not instead lose yourself in salsa dancing, stand-up comedy or the Kama Sutra? These types of activities can improve your confidence and elevate your conversations beyond the usual small talk and chit chat.
