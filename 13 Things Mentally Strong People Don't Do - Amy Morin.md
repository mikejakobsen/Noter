# 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do - Amy Morin

Don’t waste energy trying to change things beyond your control. Instead, control yourself!

You can’t escape misfortune in life. But you can change how you respond to it.

Let’s say you were hit by a bus and ended up in the hospital. Your injuries are bad enough — don’t make things worse by feeling sorry for yourself!

Self-pity is destructive. It leads to all kinds of negative emotions, and prevents you from moving forward.

Think of your hypothetical bus accident. Here, you have two options: You can summon all your energy and channel it into getting better (such as working hard at physiotherapy). Or, you can dwell on your bad luck and become stuck in a cycle of bitterness.

Trying to control everything is another impulse that can hold you back. Even though we know that many things in life are beyond our personal control, we often cling to the illusion that it’s possible to control many of life’s outcomes.

Although this belief is a common way of managing anxiety, it’s also an impulse that can damage your relationships.

After a divorce, James was terrified that his ex-wife was trying to turn their daughter against him by buying her expensive gifts that James himself couldn’t afford. But instead of spending time with his daughter and showing how much he loved her, he wasted his energy trying to control his ex- wife’s behavior. In the end, his actions damaged his relationship with his daughter.

The point is, complaining that you’re not getting something you think you deserve is a waste of energy. The world doesn’t owe you anything – but if you allow yourself to believe that it does, you’ll just end up angry and bitter.

And as a consequence, you’ll be less motivated in life and at work, which will undermine your performance and potentially start a vicious circle. If your work suffers and you’re denied a raise, for example, that will only make you angrier, damaging your performance even more.

## Don't focus on other peoples opinion.

Do you care about what other people think of you? Of course, it’s natural to care a little, but when you care too much, you let others define your self-worth – which gives them power over you.
Look at it this way – if you allow other people to dictate your behavior, you make yourself vulnerable to manipulation.

To understand this principle, consider the pressures surrounding a small child. Children depend on what the adults in their lives think and say; parents often leverage this dependance to make children behave a certain way.

A mother might tell her daughter that “big girls” don’t climb trees wearing their best dress. Since the child wants to be seen as a “big girl,” she alters her behavior.

Mentally strong adults take control of their actions and emotions, refusing to give other people the power to make them feel bad or inferior.

Of course, past experiences may paint a different picture. Children of alcoholics, for example, often grow up to become “people pleasers,” because this sort of behavior was the only way they could manage a parent’s unpredictable behavior under the influence.

Remember that taking care of yourself isn’t selfish. The Bible, for example, doesn’t say you have to put others first – it just says you have to treat your neighbor as you would treat yourself.

## Embrace changes

Change can be scary, whereas stability is comforting. Even when your daily routines are unhealthy, they are still familiar and thus feel safe.
Such comforting familiarity can make you overestimate the amount of hassle that a change might bring. And as a result, you shy away from taking any action.

But just think how easy it would be to implement a few small changes to improve your health, for example. You could start by eating fewer sweets, and perhaps take a walk each day after work.

Many people also avoid moving forward by dwelling too much on mistakes. Instead of looking for new things to accomplish, we often focus on things that went wrong in the past.

But if you want to move on, you have to forgive yourself for your past mistakes and stop worrying that you’ll repeat them in the future.

## Bad habits

From a child’s perspective, lying has its upsides. If you don’t fess up to a mistake, you might avoid mocking classmates or a scolding parent.

But unfortunately, we often carry this attitude into adulthood. When we avoid facing the consequences of our actions, it prevents us from learning from our mistakes.

**As a result, we can end up making the same mistakes, over and over again.**

Straight-up failure too isn’t the only setback you’ll encounter on the path to success. People also tend to give up when they don’t get immediate results.

The modern world encourages us to seek instant gratification and immediate results. But most of the time, achieving your goals won’t be easy. You’d better prepare for the long run and use your time and energy wisely – or you’ll just run out of steam!

## Seek solitude from the envy and resentment that only hold you back.

How often do you find yourself scanning Facebook posts, seething with envy for what other people have or are doing?

By doing so, you’re poisoning your own well. Competing with other people for success in life or for more “stuff” will only lead to resentment.

And feeling resentful makes us forget about the things in life that we truly need and value.
If you’re feeling insecure, you’re more likely to define your self-worth by comparing yourself to others.

What’s more, it’s impossible to have true friendships if you spend all your time envying what your friends have or what they do with their time.

## Learn to manage your negative emotions


Contrary to conventional wisdom, mental strength isn’t about burying your emotions. It’s about harnessing your inner power to deal with pain and weakness.

And you can learn to do this by becoming your own coach!

To start, if you allow negative feelings to hold you back, try to train yourself to shift negative emotions when you experience them.

For instance; when you notice that you’re comparing yourself to others (such as on Facebook) or craving things that friends have, step back for a moment. Remind yourself that doing so is not the right way to measure your self-worth. 
You have your own skills, talents and experiences.


Instead, make a list of your goals and values. Then create a personal definition of success. That way, next time you’re feeling jealous, you can read through the list to remind yourself that your journey is different – and unique.

## Summary

To become stronger mentally, you have to develop a better understanding of your thoughts, behavior and emotions. Learning to control your emotions and reducing negative feelings will help change your mind-set, allowing you to make decisions which you’ll feel good about.
