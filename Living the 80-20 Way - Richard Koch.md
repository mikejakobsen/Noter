# Living the 80/20 Way - Richard Koch

Some 50 years ago, computers could do little in terms of processing, yet were massive machines. But today we carry incredibly powerful computers around in our pockets!

The story of how computers evolved matches a wider trend in human activity: doing more with less. And in fact, the history of agriculture followed a similar path.

More than 300 years ago, close to 98 percent of the labor force worked in the fields, harvesting food. Due to technological advances, today in developed countries only 2 to 3 percent of the working population is involved with agriculture.
And yet we grow and harvest more food than ever!

This is the driving force behind the 80/20 principle: the best 20 percent of our efforts produce 80 percent of the results. And by applying this principle everywhere, we can transform our lives.

We tend to believe that if we spend as much time as possible working, we’ll be the most productive. Yet if you apply the 80/20 principle, you would realize that the best way to achieve more is to work less!

Say you’re a freelancer and you need to get a project done in a week. If you give yourself all week to do it, you’ll procrastinate, spending your time fiddling
around and not working on what matters.

But if you give yourself only 20 percent of the week to complete the project (just one day), then you’ll work diligently and efficiently. The end results will be better, and you’ll have more time to spend on other things.

## 80/20

Let’s say you want to take a vacation. First, you choose a destination, and then you figure out how to get there. And then finally, you go!

It’s simple, right? Luckily it’s exactly the same process you can use to change your life and start living by the 80/20 principle.

So first, pick a destination: Where do you want the 80/20 principle to take you?
Reflect upon your dreams, goals and objectives. Ask yourself, “What’s the best 20 percent of my life on which I’d like to focus?”

For example, when Steve, a restaurant owner in Cape Town, decided to start living an 80/20 life, he identified some key professional and personal areas on which to focus.

He decided that the most important things to him were starting a business, focusing on hospitality, and developing his rock music and teaching.
Once you’ve followed Steve’s example and selected a destination, you’ll need to find the best route, or how to get there.

To do so, take time to figure out how can you concentrate on these areas with the least amount of effort, but with the best results. Remember, there’s never just one path: think outside the box!

For instance, if you want to become a better salesperson, you could take lessons, find a mentor, get an entry-level job, and so on. All you need to do is figure out which path will get you where you want to go in the fastest and easiest way possible.

And lastly, remember to actually go!
You need to take action and start moving. But keep the 80/20 principle in mind: You’re trying to get the maximum result from a minimum amount of effort.

## How?

You should start by identifying your happiness islands (times when you feel happiest) and achievement islands (times when you are
the most creative or productive). And once you’ve identified these islands in your own life, you can maximize your output by focusing on them.

When you let go of your notions about the scarcity of time and start working intelligently, you can achieve miracles.

## Invest

As you may know, 20 percent of Americans own over 80 percent of the entire country’s wealth.
And many of these wealthy individuals followed the same 80/20 logic to earn their fortunes, in that they realized you can use a small amount of money to produce unbelievable returns.

In short, they relied on the effect of compounding (when profits are put to the task of generating more profit) to grow relatively tiny amounts of money into large fortunes.

To invest, you need some savings first. And saving needn’t be difficult if you do it incrementally. So for instance, you might set up a bank transfer that automatically sends a small portion of your income (consider 10 percent) into a savings account.

That’s what Steve and Helen did to realize
their 80/20 goal of buying an apartment that cost $60,000. Together, the couple had an annual income of $78,000. At the end of every month, they hardly had anything left, meaning they weren’t putting any money aside.

To avoid spending everything, they channeled 10 percent of their pay directly into a savings account. After six years, they had saved $66,000, which allowed them to buy the apartment.

## Instead of trying to please everyone, concentrate on the relationships that matter the most.


In the modern world, relationships matter. But many of us overextend ourselves. In our desire to build strong relationships with everyone, we end up pleasing no one.
Here the 80/20 principle can help, too.

Since 80 percent of our relationship satisfaction stems from just 20 percent of our actual relationships, to lead a happy life, we need to concentrate on the few relationships that actually matter, such as the ones we have with our romantic partners.

## Things will not make you happy

One Greek philosopher, Epicurus, came up with an answer that aligns with the 80/20 principle. The basic components of a good life are food, shelter, clothes, friends, freedom and thought.

And that’s it! Ultimately, he unknowingly followed the less-is-more strategy by focusing his energy on the most important tasks.


And Epicurus put this philosophy into practice by living a life ordered by the principle of simplicity. He lived with seven friends in a commune. They grew all their food themselves and didn’t worry about accumulating wealth. Instead, they spent their time writing books and sharing ideas.

If you want to follow a similar path, cut out everything in your life that doesn’t make you happy.

## Summary

The 80/20 principle says that 80 percent of what we want is generated by 20 percent of what we actually do. In other words, if you figure out what you want and focus on what makes you happy, you’ll be able to create more with less.

Make a list of things that actually matter to you and then focus your energy on them.
