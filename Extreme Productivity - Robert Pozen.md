# Extreme Productivity - Robert Pozen

Prioritize your tasks.

One approach is to break your projects down into smaller targets, for which you can set mini-deadlines. After all, if you’re like most people, you’ll only start working when the pressure begins to build.

But instead of waiting until the last minute to churn out a sloppy piece of caffeine- fuelled work, a better approach is to set smaller deadlines that split tasks up into more manageable chunks. That way you can finish your work step-by-step, well ahead of its due date.

## OHIO principle

“Only Handle it Once.” For example, say you receive an email inviting you to a conference. You quickly browse the email then set it aside. Three days later, you remember the message, but don’t remember the name of the sender. As a result, you spend countless minutes scrolling back through your inbox. From there, you’ve got to read it again, wasting yet more time!

The OHIO principle forces you to make a decision straight away.

# Summary

Productivity relies on efficiency. That means nothing will stop you from becoming a faster, smarter worker if you set clear goals and priorities. This results- driven approach will do away with procrastination, break up big projects and clearly define your working hours.
