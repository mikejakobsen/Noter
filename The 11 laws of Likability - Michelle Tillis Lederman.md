The 11 Laws of Likability - Michelle Tillis Lederman

To be likable, you have to focus on connecting with people honestly.

Most of our lives depend on our relationships. And whether they’re of a professional or personal nature, our relationships support and connect us. But how does that fact relate to networking, a term we so often see in the modern business world?

Since our networks develop as a result of our relationships, “networking” simply describes the way in which we build new relationships. It comes down to liking someone and getting her to like you.

So when you’re networking, try to recognize what’s likable about the other person as well as yourself. Find out what’s likable about others by asking questions – whether about the person’s life, opinions, beliefs, job or hobbies – and then listen actively.

Although likability is as subjective as everyone is different, the basic premises of likability are the same across the board. These basic forces can be boiled down to eleven laws of likability that we’re about to delve into one by one.

So it’s only logical that, if networking feels like a chore to you, it’s hard to find the motivation to do it, much less to do it well. Contrary to the popular belief that you should have a specific objective in mind when beginning a relationship, you shouldn’t be thinking about takeaways when getting to know someone.

According to Michelle, instead of making networking about transactions, you should make it about connections. It will benefit both you and the people you speak to. After all, the only way to make yourself likable is by being honest and authentic.

## To be likable, be your authentic self

Imagine scenarios where you think:

“I don’t like this person, but I’m trying to be nice” or “This situation makes me feel uncomfortable, but I don’t know what to do about it.” In these situations, people tend to hide their true feelings by acting overly polite, but such a strategy can be painfully obvious.

Regardless of how you feel about the person you’re speaking to, you’ve got to remain authentic.
Instead of sporting a fake smile, try looking at the people you meet with unbiased eyes. Maybe you can find something to appreciate about them. For instance, maybe they have skills in areas where you don’t. Or maybe you can feel compassion for their actions.

## Be consistent and confident

Have you ever walked away from a conversation with someone and felt like he was totally fake?

Perhaps because his body language wasn’t in sync with his words, an error that you should be certain to avoid.

Instead, you should work to communicate with consistency. Try using the three key components to communication, known as the three V’s:

The first V stands for **verbal**, or the words you say; the second is for **vocal**, or the tone of your voice; the third is **visual**, or your body language.

So keep your three V’s in chorus whenever you communicate, meaning send the same message verbally, vocally and visually.

In his book, Silent Messages, the psychologist Albert Mehrabian says that someone’s *"total liking"* is 7 percent verbal, 38 percent vocal and 55 percent visual. That means the words that come out of your mouth have close to no effect on your likability if they’re not in sync with your body language and tone of voice.
