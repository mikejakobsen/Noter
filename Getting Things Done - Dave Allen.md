# Getting Things Done - Dave Allen

To be successful in your work is to be a good organizer. Especially among knowledge workers, whose everyday reality involves juggling dozens of tasks and projects at once.

In order to keep all the complex information of our lives in check, many of us end up treating our brains like an all-in- one filing cabinet, calendar and to-do list.

We misuse our brains by packing them with all different kinds of information as though they were portable data storage devices. Where were you in that document before you got interrupted?

By stuffing our heads with information about unfinished assignments, appointments and other miscellaneous obligations, we’re squandering our brains’ capacity to think. *And this eventually leads to our inability to concentrate fully on our actual work.*

## Why?

Because, whether we want them to or not, our brains are forever trying to work out our unsolved problems and reminding us about them at the most inopportune moments  – even if we’d rather deal with them later.


In order to work as efficiently as possible, we have to keep our minds from dwelling on anything unrelated to the task we’re performing at any given moment.

## In an ideal world

In an ideal world, you’d always be able to focus entirely on whatever you were doing at any given moment, whether you’re writing an email, talking to a colleague or mowing the lawn. You’d always be fully present and focused on just that one thing.

In reality, however, our brains have an irritating way of never quite letting us forget what else we still need to take care of. We all have nagging thoughts like “Remember to buy toilet paper on the way home” and “Pay this month’s electricity bill” even when we’re not in a position to do anything about them.

To make matters more complicated, we’re constantly bombarded with new information.

**Collection bucket** 

In order to avoid this, you should always use a collection bucket, that is, a place outside your mind where you can deposit any piece of information or idea that’s bound to distract you.
